## Description

Nevu is a complete redesign of Plex's UI using the Plex media server's API. It comes with its own web server. As the keen eye may notice, the UI is heavily inspired by Netflix's UI. It is currently only developed for desktops and laptops. It is not optimized for mobile or TV use.

Nevu currently supports Movie and TV Show libraries. You can also play media via the interface.

It is currently not possible to edit media metadata or switch between different Plex servers. The "+" and Star buttons on the info pages for shows and movies are placeholders and are currently not functional.

Mind that this project is still in development and may be unstable.


## Features
- Modern, Netflix-like UI
- Seamless Plex integration
- Play media
- Browse libraries
- Search for media
- Watch Together (Nevu Sync)
- Get Recommendations
- Fully integrated Watchlist
- Simple and easy to use
- Pro-User features (like special shortcuts etc.)

## Installation

### Docker

The easiest way to run Nevu is to use Docker. You can use the following command to run Nevu in a Docker container:

```bash
docker volume create nevu_data
docker run --name nevu -p 3000:3000 -v nevu_data:/data -e PLEX_SERVER=http://your-plex-server:32400 ipmake/nevu
```

### Docker Compose

Alternatively, you can use Docker Compose to run Nevu. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following content:

```yaml
services:
    nevu:
        image: ipmake/nevu
        container_name: nevu
        ports:
            - "3000:3000"
        volumes:
            - nevu_data:/data
        environment:
            - PLEX_SERVER=http://your-plex-server:32400

volumes:
    nevu_data:
```

Then run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
